I understand that you need a system to manage a photography business with two main flows:

1. School Package Flow:
- Clients (Parents) can have multiple children in different schools
- Each child can have a bundle purchase (photos + physical items like medals)
- Need to track the components within bundles (e.g., medal inventory per student)

2. Regular Services Flow:
- Standard list of services/products
- Simple client registration and billing

Let me propose a data model approach first, then we can discuss the implementation:


```
Organization
- id
- name
- type (school, company, etc)
- address
- contact_info
- status (active/inactive)

Client
- id
- name
- contact_info
- children[] (relationship)
- organization_id (optional, relationship)
- role (parent, employee, individual)

Child
- id
- name
- school
- grade/section
- client_id (relationship)

Bundle
- id
- name
- description
- components[] (relationship)
- organization_id (optional, for org-specific bundles)
- type (school_package, organization_package, regular)

BundleComponent
- id
- type (medal, photo, certificate, etc)
- quantity
- bundle_id (relationship)

Purchase
- id
- client_id
- child_id (optional, for school packages)
- organization_id (optional)
- bundle_id (optional)
- status
- total_amount
- date

PurchaseItem
- id
- purchase_id
- item_type (bundle_component or service)
- item_id
- quantity
- price

OrganizationMember
- id
- organization_id
- client_id
- role (admin, member)
- status
- join_date
```


For the UI/UX, I would suggest:

1. Dashboard with:
   - Recent purchases
   - Inventory alerts (low medal count, etc.)
   - Upcoming school sessions

2. Client Management:
   - Client list with search/filter
   - Client profile showing all children and purchase history
   - Quick add child functionality

3. School Package Management:
   - Bundle creator/editor
   - School-wise view of purchases
   - Inventory tracking per bundle component

4. Regular Services:
   - Service catalog
   - Quick purchase flow

5. Organization Management:
   - Organization list with type filter
   - Organization profile/details
   - Member management
   - Organization-specific bundles
   - Organization purchase history
