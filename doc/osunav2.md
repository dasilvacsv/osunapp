I'll enhance the data model to include organizations while keeping all existing functionality. Here's the updated model:


Additional UI/UX sections:

5. Organization Management:
   - Organization list with type filter
   - Organization profile/details
   - Member management
   - Organization-specific bundles
   - Organization purchase history

Updated routes structure to include organizations:

```
# Organization Management
/organizations
  - OrganizationsList
  - TypeFilters
/organizations/[orgId]
  - OrganizationProfile
  - MembersList
  - OrgBundles
/organizations/[orgId]/members
  - MemberManager
  - RoleAssignment
/organizations/[orgId]/purchases
  - OrgPurchaseHistory
  - BulkOrderManager

# Additional Components
/components/features/organizations
  OrganizationCard.tsx
  MembershipForm.tsx
  OrgBundleSelector.tsx
  BulkOrderForm.tsx
```

Key changes:
1. Bundles can now be organization-specific
2. Clients can be associated with organizations
3. Organizations can have their own purchase history
4. Support for bulk orders at organization level
5. Role-based access within organizations
6. Organization-specific pricing possible through bundle association

This structure maintains all the existing functionality while adding support for organizational clients, making it flexible enough to handle both individual and organizational scenarios.
